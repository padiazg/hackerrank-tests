# HackerRank tests

I created this repo to help me access those exercises I already solved

# Run the exercises
I created unit-test files and translated the input file to them, but if you want to run the code as the platform would:
```shell
$ cd exercise
$ cat input/input00.txt | OUTPUT_PATH=res.out go run main.go && cat res.out
```
